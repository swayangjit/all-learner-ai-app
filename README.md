# Storylingo (ekstep)

## Introduction

This project aims to revolutionize language learning for children by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Designed to be engaging and educational, the project focuses on helping children learn a new language and improve their pronunciation through interactive reading exercises and AI-driven feedback.
```markdown
Key Features

    Interactive Reading Exercises:
        Children read words, phrases, or sentences displayed on the screen.
        The AI listens to their reading and provides immediate feedback.

    AI-Powered Pronunciation Detection:
        The AI detects correct and incorrect pronunciations.
        It scores the child's reading based on accuracy and fluency.

    Real-Time Feedback:

      During practice sessions, words that are not pronounced correctly are highlighted.
      This helps children identify and correct their mistakes in real-time.

    Assessment Mode:

      A game-like assessment where children read sentences displayed on the screen.
      The game includes limited lives, making it more challenging and fun.
      Each incorrect pronunciation costs one life.
      The objective is to complete the game by reading all sentences correctly without losing all lives.

    Engaging Gameplay:

      The game structure motivates children to improve their pronunciation to progress.
      It provides a fun and competitive environment to reinforce learning.

### Running the Project

To start the development server:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn run dev
```

#### Deployment
Instructions for deploying the project to a local environment.

  - You need to add these properties to the local storage manually
  -  token: 
```bash
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJlbWlzX3VzZXJuYW1lIjoiMTAxNDQwMDc4MyIsInN0dWRlbnRfbmFtZSI6InByYW5hdjEyMzQiLCJzY2hvb2xfbmFtZSI6IkNIU1MgS09ZQU1CRURVIiwic2VjdGlvbiI6IkIiLCJlbWlzX3VzZXJ0eXBlIjoiMTciLCJzdHVkZW50X2lkIjoiMTQ0MDA3ODMiLCJlbWlzX3VzZXJ0eXBlMSI6IjMxOTMiLCJzY2hvb2xfaWQiOiIzMTkzIiwiZW1haWwiOm51bGwsIm1vYmlsZSI6bnVsbCwidWRpc2VfY29kZSI6IjMzMDIwNTAwODA0IiwiY2xhc3Nfc3R1ZHlpbmdfaWQiOiI0IiwibWVkaXVtX2lkIjoiMTYiLCJncm91cF9pZCI6IjgwNyIsInN0YXR1cyI6IkFjdGl2ZSIsIm5ld3NjaGwiOm51bGwsImlhdCI6MTcxMTY5MDk4NywiZXhwIjoxNzE0MjgyOTg3fQ.sJC8wyif5PijCKZ_Epu8hhT-BD49NO8TC7xTiv2yRF8
```
Note: You can change the student_name property in the token using https://jwt.io/ for creating a new user.
  - lang: en
  - contentSessionId: 
```jsx 
once you will add the upper two fields in localstorage go to homepage and do a refresh after this open network tab you will get virtualID from generateVirtualID API then  `${usernameDetails.data.virtualID}${Date.now()}`; use this formula to create a contentSessionId and manually paste this in localstorage.
```

1. **Telemetry Service**:
   - Describe how to set up telemetry service.
   - Example:
```javascript
     export const initialize = ({ did }) => {
      if (!CsTelemetryModule.instance.isInitialised) {
      CsTelemetryModule.instance.init({});
      const telemetryConfig = {
        config: {
          pdata: {
            id: process.env.REACT_APP_ID,
            ver: process.env.REACT_APP_VER,

          ]
          // ,
          // dispatcher : {
          //   dispatch: function (event) {
          //     console.log('Event', event);
          //   }
          // }
